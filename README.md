# This repository is aimed at giving back something awasome to the open source community and the developers of aVideo and      # mainly their YouPHPTube script. Our team of contributors wheather with donations or with hard spend work have provided us         # a solution to runing out script 100% solely on NGINX. We have also made a simple script that will set things up for you but  # you can feel free to look at the code yourself and make the adjustments according to the configurations of your server. We   # have gone to great length to make the fix as generic as possible to it will fit to most of the already configured YouPHPTube   # sites out there. We truly hope this will benefit everyone wanting to run a much faster service.
